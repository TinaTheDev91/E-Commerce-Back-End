# E-Commerce-Back-End
13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

## Description

This application was created to show my ability to utilize the coding style of ORM. At this point in time, we are focused on efficient backend programming. Given my background in SQL, data/database management, I have learned that backend programming is where I thrive. Through this project, I was able to grasp the amount of possibilities there are as a backend developer.

This project functions as a database for business, tracking inventory and product details. It features multiple GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes across 3 tables with built in relationships and uses sequelize to execute the updates to these tables.

## Installation

This project is only accessible by downloading the repository and running the routes via your preferred API tool (such as Insomnia or Postman). 

## Usage

When using the application, the data you see should resemble what's pictured below. If you encounter errors, or see data that doesn't resemble, please email me at TinaTheDev91@gmail.com.
